# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
The school district needs help to analyze data from differnt schools to help make informed decisions on their budgets and overall performance of the schools. The district would like an overview of data based on each school's budget, performace, size, and type. The school district has also informed the data analysis team of a school which had some academic dishonesty and would like another analysis to view any discrepencies and to see how it affects the data.

# Analysis
The **District Summary** shows that there are 15 schools in the district with a total of 39,170 students and a total budget of $24,649,428.00. The overall passing percentag is 64.9%. The **Top Schools** relative to overall passing percentage are all charter schools with a student body size of 962-2283 students. These schools spend no more than $638.00 per student. The **Bottom Schools** relative to overall passing percentage are all district schools with a student body size of 2917-4761 students. These schools spend up to $655.00 per student. The overall passing percentage is relective of the **Math and Reading Scores** of the schools. Throughout each school, we see that no matter which grade the student is in, the grades will be consistent. This means that the school's math and reading programs are consistent from grade to grade. The reading scores are higher than the math scores for most schools.

## Insights
The data shows that there is a correlation between the type of school and the overall scores. Charter schools typically have smaller class sizes, which is shown to increase the overall passing percentage. These schools also tend to spend less per student. This directly stems from the **Scores Based on Budget**, **Scores Based on Size**, and **Scores Based on Type**.

## Recommended Analysis
A breakdown of budget per school is recommened. What is each school spending their money on? This would give the district more insights into why the costs per student increase with increased class size. This could be due to wages going up, or building maintenance increasing. The current data does not show where it goes.

It would be nice to see the costs incrued by the individual families for each school. Typically it's more expensive to send a student to a charter school than a district school. It would be valuable insight to see how much it costs per school. 

District to District Analysis. It would be nice to compare this district with other districts to see how it compares. Depending on the goals of the district, this could provide insight into where it stands among other districts and possibly help reach out to other districts for insights or knowledge to improve passing percentages.

## Academic Dishonesty
The accademic dishonesty which occured at Thomas High School by the ninth graders did not have a statistical affect on the overall analysis of the budget, type, or school size data. 

The dishonesty of the class and removal of the grades affected the overall passing percentage of the school comparatively with other schools. This creates a bias towards Thomas High School due to missing data. Once the data can be determined, a full analysis should be performed again. This also creates a lense in which the district must determine if any of the other schools have been dishonest and what kind of trends do they show. 

Affected Values
- Average Math Score
  - Increased from 67% to 93%
- Average Reading Score
  - Increased from 70% to 97%
- Overall Passing Percentage
  - Increased from 65% to 91%
- Top and Bottom Schools
  - Thomas High School is shown to be in the Top Schools based on overall passing percentage. This is bias created from missing data points.
