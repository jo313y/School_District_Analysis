# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
The school district needs help to analyze data from differnt schools to help make informed decisions on their budgets and overall performance of the schools. The district would like an overview of data based on each school's budget, performace, size, and type. The school district has also informed the data analysis team of a school which had some academic dishonesty and would like another analysis to view any discrepencies and to see how it affects the data.
